  summary: Use your mobile device as a localized desktop keyboard.
  description: |
    Influenced by this [april fools post](http://www.google.co.jp/ime/furikku/) from Google, there are no Japanese flick keyboards available on the consumer market for PCs.
    To fulfill this need I have created a desktop application that streams a mobile device's keyboard inputs to the desktop, allowing for the use of localized mobile keyboards on the desktop without any additional peripherals.
    While initially created for Japanese, it is functional for any mobile language keyboard.

    Originally created to resolve an issue where Google Chrome continues to run in the background when all windows are closed, even when background apps are turned off.
    Also solves the issue of Google Chrome not launching because it's stuck running in the background for no good reason.

  summary: The MTA Bus and Subway APIs all in one Java library.
  description: |
    In order to create applications and systems dependent on the MTA API, this library was created to simply the usage of the [MTA Bus REST API](https://bustime.mta.info/wiki/Developers/SIRIIntro) and the [MTA Subway Realtime GTFS API](https://api.mta.info/#/landing).
    Condenses these two poorly documented APIs into a singular, well documented Java library.
